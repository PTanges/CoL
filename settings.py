US uses progressive income. This calculator ignores that for an overly generous flat 30% and also ignores regional city or state specific taxes.

Also these numbers are the unadjusted values. This assumes 52 work weeks or 260 weekdays of a year. Ignores holidays and paid vacations.

Additional information worth knowing:
Ballpark 20% of income going towards savings, including 401k if you're able to. Be sure to research what a 401k is in regards to retirement!

Also when you file taxes, if you make under a set amount (about $70,000 annually)... tax companies are required to file it for you for free. Take advantage of it! It'll require a bit of research since they don't want you to know about that law
- This varies per year

I recommend padding savings for certain *required* expeditures for the future if you're able to. For example... save an extra $10 a month extra solely for your phone. Should your phone last 2-3 years, you'll have 240-360 saved just for a new replacement when it inevitably breaks. It will eventually. Also car... etc
